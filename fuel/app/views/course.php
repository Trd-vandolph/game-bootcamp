		We teach students enchant.js.
		<br>
		echant.js is a game engine that enables students to create a program by writing simple codes and can work on Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android. 
		<br>
		The reason we chose enchant.js is it is built on the basis of HTML and JavaScript.
		<br>
		As HTML and JavaScript are the first programming languages to be mastered in the world of programming, students can apply what they learn in our course to other advanced programming smoothly. Mastering enchant.js makes it easier for students to go a step further to the next stage.
