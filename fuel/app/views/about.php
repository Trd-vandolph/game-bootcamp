	<p class="sub-catch">We set up our service to realize your hidden potential and change your life.</p>
	<div class="text">
		<p>We name the service “OliveCode”.</p>
		<p>Olive represents “wisdom” in Greek mythology and pigeon holding olive in its mouth represents “peace” in the Bible. Olive bears a lot of fruits for centuries if we keep giving nutritious materials to it. We believe all these images of olive fit with our concept of the service</p>
